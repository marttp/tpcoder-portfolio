I subscribed to Medium Premium the year I graduated in Computer Engineering. Back then, it felt like a mandatory investment — not a luxury. Behind that paywall lived system design deep dives, battle-tested architecture lessons, and career advice from staff engineers who had actually shipped systems at scale. Five dollars a month for continuous learning from people who had been in the trenches? That was an easy yes.

Several years later, I found myself asking a question I never expected to ask: **is this still worth it?**

This is not a rage-quit post. This is an honest reassessment from someone who genuinely valued the platform — and gradually realized the return had quietly gone negative.

## The Golden Era Was Real

Let me be fair first. Early Medium Premium delivered genuine value for me as a backend engineer.

I discovered articles on caching strategies, distributed system pitfalls, and trade-offs in event-driven architectures — written by engineers who had the scars to prove it. These were not rehashed tutorials. They were experience distilled into writing. The signal-to-noise ratio was high enough that scrolling my feed actually felt productive.

I remember finding an article on rate-limiting design patterns that directly influenced how I approached a production system. Another one on consistent hashing helped me understand concepts that no official documentation explained with that level of practical context.

That era, from my experience, is over.

## What Changed — Three Shifts I Cannot Ignore

### 1. AI Closed the Knowledge Gap

This is the most obvious shift. LLMs now cover a significant portion of what a typical Medium technical article used to provide. Need to understand how consistent hashing works? Need a comparison between event sourcing and CQRS? Need a quick refresher on Kubernetes networking concepts? You can get a tailored, interactive explanation from an AI assistant in seconds — for free.

The kind of "here is concept X explained simply" article that once justified a Medium subscription is now commodity knowledge. And honestly, AI does not just match these articles — it often beats them, because it adapts to your specific context and lets you ask follow-up questions on the spot.

If you already have a firm grasp of your domain and know what questions to ask, a conversational AI is frequently a faster and more effective technical partner than a static blog post behind a paywall.

### 2. Content Quality Collapsed

Here is what I notice now when I open Medium: the same topics recycled endlessly. "10 things every developer should know." "Why microservices might not be right for you." "Clean code principles that changed my life." Written by someone who read the same three books I did, repackaged into a five-minute post, optimized for the Partner Program payout.

Some of these articles are literally rephrased documentation. I have clicked into premium-locked articles only to find content I could have read — for free — on the official docs of the framework in question. When you are trying to solve a complex architectural problem or implement a new library, paying to read someone else's summary of a public README is a poor use of resources. The original documentation is usually more accurate, better maintained, and free.

Human writing — complete with battle scars, nuanced opinions, and edge-case survival stories — is becoming increasingly rare on the platform. Instead, it is saturated with generic overviews that lack the depth required by engineers who have moved past the fundamentals.

### 3. The Incentive Structure Broke

This is the core problem. Medium's Partner Program pays writers based on engagement. Engagement rewards clickbait. Clickbait rewards volume over depth. The result is a flood of shallow content from writers optimizing for revenue, not for the reader.

I have to say this bluntly: a noticeable segment of premium writers leverages the system not to share knowledge, but to farm clicks. Sensationalized titles, superficial content, and low-effort posts designed solely to capture attention and earn revenue. When you are building products or steering technical direction, your time is your most valuable asset. Sifting through that noise to find a single actionable insight is an inefficient workflow.

Meanwhile, the writers who actually have deep expertise? Many of them moved to personal blogs, Substacks, or company engineering blogs — places where they control the format and do not have to compete with AI-generated listicles for attention.

## When Medium Premium Might Still Make Sense

I am not saying the value is absolute zero. There are scenarios where it holds up:

**You are early in your career.** If you are a junior developer still building mental models, curated human writing can provide structure that raw AI output sometimes lacks. The narrative arc of a well-written article sometimes teaches better than a chatbot response. I benefited from this myself in my first years — so I will not pretend otherwise.

**You follow specific writers who consistently deliver.** A handful of authors still publish genuinely original work — proprietary insights from their own production systems, contrarian takes backed by real data. If you follow them and they publish on Medium, the subscription might pay for itself. But you are paying for three or four people, not the platform.

**You value serendipity.** AI gives you answers to questions you already know to ask. A human-written article can surface problems or perspectives you had not considered. That serendipity has value — but it is getting harder to find under the noise.

---

## The Math Does Not Lie

Medium Premium costs $60 per year. Ask yourself honestly: in the last 12 months, how many premium articles gave you something you could not have gotten from official documentation, a targeted AI conversation, or a free engineering blog?

If the answer is fewer than five, you are paying $12 per genuinely useful article. From a practical standpoint, that is a bad deal.

## Where I Actually Learn Now

For anyone reconsidering their subscription, here is what has gradually replaced Medium in my own learning stack:

**Official documentation.** The source of truth. Always free. Often better written than the Medium article summarizing it. As a backend engineer, I find myself going straight to the Spring, Kotlin, or Rust docs far more than I used to.

**Company engineering blogs.** Uber, Stripe, Netflix, Cloudflare — these teams publish real-world architecture decisions with actual production data. No paywall. Real depth.

**AI assistants.** For concept exploration, debugging mental models, and rapid Q&A. Not perfect, but faster and more interactive than any static article.

**Targeted books.** When I need depth, I invest in a proper resource. Books like _System Design Interview_ or _The Software Engineer's Guidebook_ gave me far more lasting value than hundreds of Medium articles combined.

**Open-source codebases.** Reading real code teaches more than reading about code. This is something I learned the hard way through side projects — and it remains true.

## My Honest Conclusion

Medium Premium was a great deal when the best technical minds wrote there and alternatives were limited. Today, the best minds increasingly write elsewhere, AI handles the fundamentals, and the platform's incentive structure actively selects for low-quality content.

If you still find consistent value in your subscription, keep it — I respect that. But if you are renewing out of habit like I was, take an honest look at your reading history. You might find that you have been paying for content you no longer consume, or content that no longer deserves the price tag.

My action for now? Let me try canceling it and see if it actually affects my daily workflow. If it does not — and I suspect it will not — then it is definitely goodbye. Either way, that $60 is better spent on a technical book or a domain name for your own blog. Invest in creating rather than consuming.

_These are my own opinions, based on years of subscribing and gradually realizing the ROI had quietly gone negative. Your experience may differ — but from the conversations I have had with fellow engineers, I suspect it will not differ by much._
