AI agents are everywhere now — coding assistants, autonomous cars, game NPCs, recommendation engines. But not all agents are built the same way. The term "AI agent" covers a wide spectrum of architectures, from a thermostat that flips on when the room gets cold to a swarm of agents negotiating with each other in real time.

Understanding the different types helps you pick the right architecture for the problem you're solving. Over-engineering a simple automation with a full planning agent is wasteful. Under-engineering a complex decision system with a basic reactive agent is fragile.

This post breaks down **10 types of AI agents**, how each one works, and where they fit in practice.

## The Classic Foundation: Russell & Norvig's Agent Types

Before diving in, it's worth noting that many of these types trace back to Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig's textbook *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* (Chapter 2). Their taxonomy — simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents — forms the foundation that the broader AI community has expanded upon. The 10 types below include these classics plus several additional architectures that have become important in modern AI systems.

## Comparison Table

| Type | Memory | Learning | Planning | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reactive | No | No | No | Simple, fast responses |
| Reflex + Memory | Yes | No | No | Context-aware reactions |
| Model-Based | Yes | No | Partial | Partially observable environments |
| Goal-Based | Yes | No | Yes | Clear objective pursuit |
| Utility-Based | Yes | No | Yes | Multi-objective optimization |
| Learning | Yes | Yes | Varies | Improving over time |
| Rational | Varies | Varies | Yes | Optimal decision-making |
| Task-Specific | Varies | Varies | Varies | Focused domain tasks |
| Planning | Yes | Varies | Yes | Complex multi-step tasks |
| Multi-Agent | Yes | Varies | Yes | Large-scale distributed problems |

## Choosing the Right Agent Type

There's no single "best" type — it depends on your problem:

- **Simple, well-defined environment?** Start with a **reactive agent**. Don't over-engineer.
- **Need context from past interactions?** Add memory — use a **reflex agent with memory** or **model-based agent**.
- **Clear goal to achieve?** Use a **goal-based agent**.
- **Multiple competing objectives?** Use a **utility-based agent**.
- **Complex multi-step task?** Use a **planning agent**.
- **Environment changes and you need adaptation?** Use a **learning agent**.
- **One specific domain to optimize?** Use a **task-specific agent**.
- **Problem too big for one agent?** Use a **multi-agent system**.

In practice, most production AI systems are **hybrids**. A self-driving car combines reactive components (emergency braking), model-based reasoning (predicting traffic), utility-based decision-making (balancing speed and safety), and learning (improving from driving data). The art is in knowing which architecture to apply where.
