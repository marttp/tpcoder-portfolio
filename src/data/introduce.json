  "statement": "\"The more I worked, The more impact I made on people\" I'm a software engineer who is passionate about distributed systems, designing system solutions, cloud computing, and cloud-native/serverless architecture. And I have some experience working in Android (Kotlin) full-stack development also. I love to solve business problems with my coding & problem-solving skills. Love to see my work can make a good impact on one, ten to billion people meanwhile I can develop my skill set to be better for myself and love to teach and pass them to others, so I'm actually great at mentoring other developers. Give more, learn more. Be better each day. Be kind and be inspired. the three sentences that I always keep in mind as mission-driven in my career path. In my free time, I write some articles about the technology that I'm interested in, research, and learn news from somewhere."
