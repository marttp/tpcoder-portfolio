        "Led the enhancement of a mission-critical campaign management platform to enable secure data handling within a dedicated support room, collaborating with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless integration with existing functionalities. Eliminated costly SMS communications, saving 3 million yen annually.",
        "Supported and mentored the sub-team to develop the new feature for marketing communication strategy systems",
        "Re-engineered PayPay's personalized asset delivery system, replacing a legacy multi-tenant Akka-based solution with a streamlined Spring Boot 3.2 (Kotlin) application utilizing coroutines and asynchronous caching. Achieved 8,000 RPS with minimal latency, exceeding the system's peak demand of 7,000 RPS, while eliminating 80% of dead code inherited from a previous Paytm implementation. Overcame performance bottlenecks by adopting Kotlin coroutines for a highly efficient asynchronous architecture.",
        "Reduced infrastructure cost for $1500 by detected unused push silent service which were running on production and processed to remove them",
        "Noticed the FCM legacy API usage and migrated to Firebase Admin SDK approach to send to group of target device before the application cannot using push notification without further error.",
        "Introduced a plan for the multi-stage upgrade from Spring Boot 2.2 with JDK 8 to Spring Boot 3.3 with JDK 17. Ensured seamless transition and uninterrupted service delivery throughout the 3-month modernization process. Migrated the build system from Maven to Gradle and integrated the platform with PayPay's golden image to improve build efficiency, dependency management, and standardization.",
        "Spearheaded the architecture and development of high-throughput, low-latency push notification services handling 120+ million daily notifications for diverse PayPay use cases, including transactional and promotional campaigns.",
        "Led the migration of 36 Spark-Scala ETL jobs and 51 data lake tables to a new data lake, collaborating with the DaaS team to achieve a cost reduction of 548,000 yen daily (200 million yen annually).",
        "Collaborated across tech/non-tech teams, designed the timeline notification delivery system from scratch including drafting, functional/non-functional requirements, and implemented the workloads with Kotlin - Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux with the Cadence Workflow, and Kafka integration. As a result, Reduced 100 hours per month for the marketing team, unlocked capabilities for marketing team to create workflow during weekends, and Increased annual GMV by 4M JPY.",
        "Documented the procedure for production manual operation with readable format and easier to follow.",
        "Implemented APM on the legacy inherited Spring Boot microservice to able to have the capability of observing the microservice.",
        "Investigate the feasibility of implementing the approach for limiting the number of database connections and identifying the problem. Followed by optimizing the code change to use the connection pool configuration with HikariCP on the Spring Boot microservice. As a result, the application has a fixed-size pool and also increases the stability and reliability of the core microservice in the ecosystem.",
        "Implemented a Spark job for grouping the audience based on conditions for creating the campaign and audience with good documentation in Scala programming language. The results of the job are used for the marketing team to create a campaign and audience for the marketing campaign to increase GMV. For example, one job has increased GMV for 10M JPY per month.",
        "Analyzed and developed from the feasible investigation documentation in action by extending the lifetime of data and managing the workflow in Spring Boot and Cadence workflow. As a result, the new business can use the same system that exists used.",
        "Feasible investigation on the infrastructure and applications scaling impact for support of new business epic. Identify workload increasing as calculation memory usage based on current systems and provide points to make the technical changes."
